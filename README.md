# RowLang
I invented RowLang, a minimalistic esoteric programming language based on an analogy to rowing.

## Technical Description of RowLang

RowLang is a domain-specific esoteric programming language designed for symbolic computation, inspired by the movements and dynamics of rowing. 
It offers a minimalistic yet expressive syntax, combining memory manipulation with the metaphorical representation of rowing actions. 
RowLang programs are composed of commands, loops, and formations, providing a unique perspective on algorithmic expression.

## Syntax and Semantics

- **Commands:** RowLang commands correspond to rowing maneuvers and memory operations:
  - `P`: Pull - Move the memory pointer to the right.
  - `R`: Recover - Move the memory pointer to the left.
  - `S`: Stroke - Increment the byte at the current memory cell.
  - `B`: Back - Decrement the byte at the current memory cell.
  - `.`: Catch - Output the byte at the current memory cell as a character.
  - `,`: Release - Input a character and store its ASCII value in the current memory cell.
- **Loops:** RowLang supports loop constructs enclosed within `[...]`, facilitating repetitive execution of commands until the value of the current memory cell becomes zero.
- **Formations:** By utilizing `{...}`, RowLang enables parallel execution of commands, simulating the synchronized movements of rowers in a regatta race.
- **Stroke Rate Adjustment:** The `^` and `v` commands allow for dynamic adjustment of the stroke rate, regulating the speed of program execution to simulate changes in rowing intensity and pacing.

## Implementation

- **Lexer and Parser:** RowLang compilers typically employ lexical analysis and parsing techniques to translate source code into a structured representation, such as an abstract syntax tree (AST), facilitating further analysis and transformation.
- **Code Generation:** During code generation, RowLang compilers translate the parsed representation of the program into executable code, often targeting a lower-level language such as C or assembly. This process involves mapping RowLang commands and constructs to equivalent machine instructions or function calls.
- **Optimization:** While RowLang prioritizes simplicity and metaphorical expression, compilers may apply optimization techniques to enhance the efficiency and performance of generated code. Common optimizations include loop unrolling, constant folding, and dead code elimination.
- **Execution:** RowLang programs are executed by interpreters or virtual machines capable of interpreting the generated code and simulating the behavior of RowLang commands and constructs. Interpreters typically iterate through the program's instructions, updating memory state and performing I/O operations as necessary.

## Applications and Use Cases

- **Education and Exploration:** RowLang serves as an educational tool for introducing programming concepts in a playful and engaging manner. Its metaphorical approach encourages learners to visualize algorithms as sequences of rowing actions, facilitating comprehension and retention.
- **Artistic Expression:** As an esoteric programming language, RowLang appeals to artists and enthusiasts interested in creative coding and algorithmic art. Its symbolic language offers a canvas for expressing ideas and concepts through the lens of rowing culture and imagery.
- **Algorithmic Challenges:** Despite its whimsical nature, RowLang retains computational power, enabling programmers to tackle algorithmic challenges and puzzles. Its simplicity and metaphorical abstraction provide a platform for exploring computational concepts in unconventional ways.

## Conclusion

RowLang embodies the intersection of programming and metaphorical expression, offering a unique lens through which to view computational concepts. Its minimalist syntax and rowing-inspired semantics provide a canvas for creativity, exploration, and technical experimentation. Whether used for educational purposes, artistic endeavors, or algorithmic challenges, RowLang invites programmers to navigate the waters of symbolic computation with curiosity and imagination.
